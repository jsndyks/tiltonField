### Views from the Village

We received _26 individual responses_ to our request for views on the proposed policy to ban dogs on Tilton Playing Field.

The request was made through the Parish Council WhatsApp group and via noticed at the entrances to the Playing Field.

Participants were asked to answer two closed questions about the proposed policy and then express their views in an open response.

#### Question 1

> 1. If the choice were to **allow dogs to use the field all of the time**, or to **ban them completely**,<br/>_which would be your choice_?

### Ban dogs from the Playing Field completely <br/>

_**Four** people were in favour of the proposed ban ..._

#### Ban - View #1 :

<div class="view">Ban dogs from the Playing Field completely</div>

#### Ban - View #2 :

<div class="view"> My view is that dog excrement (as a dog owner myself by the way) or even attempts at clearing it up and children do not mix. Dog excrement by nature is a danger to eye health and allowing dogs into an area designed for children to play in is hazardous. With the best will in the world even if someone clears up after their dog sometimes it can be hard to remove all evidence. In this case it only needs a small child to come into contact with it and they could be in danger of harming their sight. For this reason I do not support the use of the park for dogs at anytime and find a time restriction to be irrelevant to the case. </div>

#### Ban - View #3 :

<div class="view"> I don’t believe dogs should be allowed on a playing field where it is used for village activities and especially where children are most likely to be using the field, as dog excrement is dangerous to children's health. No disrespect to dog owners but it’s not nice having to look down all the time to check you’re not treading on any of it which takes the joy out of the activities.  </div>

#### Ban - View #4 :

<div class="view"> I don’t have a dog but have occasionally used the playing field and on many occasions I have seen dog mess on the grass and loose dogs running around with no sign of an owner or responsible person.
There are plenty of footpaths around the area to walk your dog of the leash when sheep are not present.
So what to do?

There are two options, ban dogs completely or allow dogs on a lead whereby the owner can pick up any dog mess right away.

How would you police either of these two policies or any other for that matter? </div>

### Continue with the existing shared use policy - dogs allowed before 2pm <br/>

_Ten people were in favour of retaining the current shared use policy ..._

<div class="view">Continue with the existing shared use policy - dogs allowed before 2pm</div>

#### Continue - View #2 :

<div class="view"> I can see both sides of this proposal having a child and more recently a dog. We are responsible dog owners and always pick up our dogs mess. If we didn't have a dog then I would probably be voting for a ban but we do have a dog and she is always with us so if the ban occurs then we would more than likely not use the playing field unfortunately.

We moved to Tilton just over a year ago and the discovery of the playing field was an amazing bonus - it's great fun for our _[redacted]_ year old boy and his friends with the added benefit of a safe space for our small dog to have some time off the lead. It's such a shame that some people are irresponsible dog owners. </div>

#### Continue - View #3 :

<div class="view"> The times I’ve walked my dog there I’ve never come across dog poo but have come across litter & glass bottles. </div>

#### Continue - View #4 :

<div class="view"> I believe dogs should be allowed on the playing field before 2 pm.

The higher profile of the dog mess problem caused by a very small number of irresponsible owners is serving to make sure people clean up after them. Other free ranging animals, cats, foxes etc. defecate in the field so it will never be completely free of faeces. If enforceable, I believe a fine or similar penalty should be imposed on offenders. </div>

#### Continue - View #5 :

<div class="view"> It is a Community space bought for the village with help from villagers. Some of those will be responsible dog owners who exercise their pets responsibly wherever they take them, field or street, and want to use that space as a safe place to visit with their dog.
I understand the concern re infections from dog mess, but the incidence is very low.
Yes it is an emotive part of the discussion, no one wants any health issue to arise, but we are open to many risks in life and need to look after ourselves and children to be aware of these.
</div>

#### Continue - View #6 :

<div class="view"> As a relatively “new” dog owner, I have gained a better perspective on this issue more recently. As we live near to the field & my daughter has used the field over many years, I appreciate the health risk, especially to kids, so that the field remains safe. We now mainly use the field for the dog to have a good run around. Since we’re close to the field, I’ve been able to monitor for dog poo most days over the last couple of months & haven’t found any.

I certainly wouldn’t claim there haven’t been any, but would appreciate some context on the statement in the dog policy “... prevalence of dog faeces ...”.

- Is this one or two dog poos in the 2 months monitoring, or the same one found twice?
- Or an issue every day / every week?
- Do we know if there have been any instances of ill health related to this issue over the past 8 years or so?

I think these facts would assist in assessing the level of risk - is the field currently deemed “unsafe” & if so, based on which facts & guidance?

If we are take a zero tolerance approach to this risk & ban dogs at all times, in the interests of fairness, will we deal with other risks & nuisance similarly?
E.g. glass left on the field, noise levels late in the evening, especially during summer?

As a related issue but one raised elsewhere in the supporting documentation, I’ve found surprisingly limited options for my dog to run around off lead around Tilton. Trafficked lanes are a no go, a lot of footpaths don’t have dog friendly styles & we can’t get through. The dog has has a couple of belts from electric fences which are commonplace and livestock in many fields where footpaths cross is very limiting. The playing field has therefore been a great option for us & would be grateful to receive info on other similar options within walking distance.

I’m not clear how we ended up with current time restrictions (i.e. not after 2pm) rather than recommendation 14 (ref the original Dog Policy) & whether this would impact users. </div>

#### Continue - View #7 :

<div class="view"> We would be really disappointed if the decision is to ban dogs on the playing field completely. Living near to the field we do make use of it regularly for exercising our dog in the absence of many other off lead options.
As parents of a young child we equally use the trim trail and equipment and fully understand the health issues raised.

We will obviously conform to whatever is put in place and would presume and expect that any decisions made will be based on ongoing gathered evidence and facts that this has become a health issue rather than just opinion.

In the interest of equality across all the village community groups/users are there any plans to put in place time restrictions around use/noise late into the evening during the summer months and also on food and drink items being brought to the field given the broken glass bottles found in the trim trail area?

Has the recommendation from ROSPA been considered regarding segregating areas, as is utilised in many recreation areas? ( eg segregating the trim trail area)

<div class="view"> Irresponsible dog owners need to be punished rather than prohibiting all dogs.  </div>

#### Continue - View #9 :

<div class="view"> The playing field provides a facility for all residents of Tilton and Halstead and it is regularly used by locals to exercise dogs and to socialise with other dog owners. I do not own a dog and am a parent with children who enjoy playing on the field. The play and exercise equipment have been a fantastic addition to the village and I am so grateful for all the work that has gone into establishing this facility. My children have enjoyed using the playing field and have done so happily without any difficulties from dogs or their owners. I would vote to keep the policy as it stands. </div>

### Allow dogs on the Playing Field all of the time <br/>

_**Thirteen** people were in favour of allowing dogs on the field at all times ..._

#### Allow - View #1 :

<div class="view">
I can see the playing field from my property and 
<!-- My garden backs onto the playing field and --->
Today Sunday 5th March I saw 8 different people using the back field all had dogs with them ,enjoying the field. If you were to ban dogs it would hardly be used and that would be a waste of a local amenity. I would also like to say that families use the field with both children and dogs together.

Unfortunately banning people with their dogs on the playing field will not stop the problem of dog poo!!! The very few people who would not pick up after their dog won't even know or care about any policies!!!

Here are some valid points to think about from _The Dog Trust_

- poorer health and welfare for dogs, if they aren't getting enough off-lead exercise

- behavioural problems for dogs if they aren't interacting enough with other dogs

- poorer social wellbeing for dog owners if they're meeting fewer other owners

- responsible dog owners being given a bad name

- a negative impact on local dog-friendly businesses.

As mentioned about exercising your dog on many quiet lanes around the area that is just not the best option due to cars speeding and not being safe Most fields in the area also have livestock so you can't offer off lead exercise for your dog.

I also have on a few occasions picked up poo that didn't belong to me as a responsible dog owner,if you ban us off the playing field - who would then pick up the rogue dog poo if there are no dog walkers?

 </div>

#### Allow - View #2 :

<div class="view"> I have noticed that the majority of the users of the field have a dog with them. In the morning while standing looking out our rear window, as our house backs onto the field. The people using the field in the morning, which is surprisingly a high number are all local dog walkers and are always seen walking away with poo bags in hand.
If you ban dogs you will ban the majority of the users.

My children have prob used it over the last few years as much as any other child has! and not once have they had an issue with dog poo any more then fox or cat poo.
I think that some, prob not all of the dog poo found on the field is from people who don't even live in the village, using the church, pub, or walking routes and exercising their dogs, will they know or care about a dog ban. </div>

#### Allow - View #3 :

<div class="view">I have several thoughts on the issue will try and not ramble.<br/><br/>

1.  The field is for everyone in the village
2.  It is mainly used by dog walkers and most of them are responsible about picking up after their dogs
3.  There is also cat and fox poo in the field , which will still be there if you ban dogs .
4.  The area is used by dog walkers who want to socialise their dogs in a safe and secure environment. The only other place you can really free run your dog is down the track at the bottom of Marefield lane , which has its draw backs ie motor bikes , off roaders and people riding .
5.  Maybe if there was a bin at one of the gates for the bags of poo that may encourage the few who don’t pick up now to pick up .
6.  The field is not used very often during the day by children, week or weekend., As with the gym equipment and climbing run.

I feel very strongly that dogs should be allowed to use the field otherwise it’s just a under used space which is a shame </div>

#### Allow - View #4 :

<div class="view"> I fully understand the issue and it’s a shame that the actions of a few ruin it for the majority.

Personally as a responsible dog owner I believe that the space can be shared and enjoyed by everyone if they exercise common sense and respect.

I would like to see the space still made available to dog owners but I feel that the priority should be given to those individuals who are using the space to exercise or play.

What I mean by this is, if someone is using the space for that purpose then dog owners should not enter the area and should take their dogs elsewhere. I also feel that if a person or group arrives to use the space and a dog is on the field the dog and owner should vacate the space within 5 minutes.

But if the space is not being used then I feel it should be available to dog owners to exercise their pets. There are occasions when a walk isn’t an option for the owner but a good fifteen minutes of fetch can provide the dog with the stimulation it needs. As already stated it would be such a shame for this facility to be restricted.

I have read the documents and I can empathise totally with the view but what I’m not clear on is the true extent of the issue.

Bites can be avoided if the sharing methodology I have suggested is adhered to but is there any data regarding the amount of faeces that is being left? Is there a disconnect between perception and reality? I’ll admit I have never encountered the issue whilst I have used the field and have never witnessed anyone not picking up after their dog. Clearly it happens for it to have been raised but can this be monitored and the results be shared? </div>

#### Allow - View #5 :

<div class="view"> Dogs & dog ownership reflect the rural feel of Tilton. All of the supporting information provided does not provide to the lay-person a balanced view - there is no commentary at all about the benefits of dog responsible ownership & how the field provides valuable safe space to exercise & train your family pet.

No information is provided about the quantity of visits people make to the field & the proportion of those visits made by people owning a dog. I would suggest that over the calendar year dog owners are the most frequent & regular users of the field. Village social media has over the period received numerous photographs of dog faeces found on the field; yet there are none showing the responsible behavior of the majority of dog owners. Perhaps we should post photographs picking our dogs mess up in an attempt to provide balance?

I fully acknowledge that irresponsible dog ownership is not acceptable but to penalize the majority for the actions of a minority does not seem just. There are many occasions when the behaviour of some adults & young people leaving the pub at night causes disturbance (& littering of drug related activity in the bus stop) yet there is no call to ban everyone from going to the pub. </div>

#### Allow - View #6 :

<div class="view"> I don't live in the village. I am staying in a holiday rental in Tilton for a week. We have a German Shepherd dog and have used the playing field for off-lead exercise. I always pick up our dogs poop but couldn't find a bin nearby to dispose of it. I'm not familiar with the area, so I'm not sure if there are alternative options for off-lead exercise. If you ban dogs from the playing field, might this lead to visitors letting there dogs off-lead in fields where there might be a risk to farm animals?

Many of the yellow-posted public walkways are not suitable for a dog such as ours, as he wouldn't be able to navigate the stiles. As a visitor to your beautiful village, it would be good to know where dogs are permitted, for both on-lead walks and off-lead exercise, and also where the nearest bin is. I think it would be a real shame to ban dogs from the playing field. Socialisation with other dogs and people is a really important part of their development and shared open spaces, such as the playing field, are a key part of this. </div>

#### Allow - View #7 :

<div class="view"> I regularly use the playing field to exercise my dog, as it is a safe, enclosed space, free of livestock (unlike most of the fields in and around Tilton). I have never seen any dog excrement on the field. In all the years I have even using the field, I have seen children playing on it only two or three times. If there were children playing when I arrived, I would leave, but there just aren’t. It’s a nice idea to have all the equipment in there for the children of the village but it looks like they don’t use it. </div>

#### Allow - View #8 :

<div class="view"> As a responsible dog owner who picks up any mess my dog makes I would be extremely sad to see dog owners unable to use the playing field due to an irresponsible few. This space has been invaluable to me as a safe and contained area to train my dog off lead where local lanes are not safe or fitting for this type of exercise. It is nice to have somewhere where my dog can be let of lead under control without the risk of being hit by a car.

As a regular user of the field I can also say that I have never seen other dog mess left only cat! The addition of a bin would maybe would encourage more clean up, as I have to put the poo in my car and use the bin near the shop on my way home which is far from ideal. It’s hard to ask people to do something when you’re not making it as easy as possible for the to abide by the rules, although I agree if you have a dog cleaning up after it is all part and parcel.

</div>

#### Allow - View #9 :

<div class="view"> A bin provided for rubbish and dog poo bags should leave no excuse for not picking up after dogs. Dogs to be controlled on leads as not everyone is a dog fan </div>

#### Allow - View #10 :

<div class="view"> Given the amount of litter left in the summer I don’t see that people care enough about the space to ban dogs wanting a game of fetch.

There are other facilities in the village to take your kids to which are dog free.

Screaming & obnoxious kids are more of a nuisance than a dog running around.

This is the ONLY secure space in the village for dogs. It’s unfair to take this away due to the occasional moron not picking up dog poo. By the same logic no one should be allowed to use the space due to morons not picking up litter. </div>

#### Allow - View #11 :

<div class="view"> Unfortunately it only takes one or two irresponsible dog owners to spoil it for the majority. If these people or person don’t play by the rules over picking up after their dogs do you honestly think they will take notice of a ban on the field, they will probably laugh and carry on regardless!!

I put it too you that they probably don’t even know they are causing this much of an issue to others because they aren’t on the village WhatsApps group and might not integrate within. Could I suggest a leaflet drop around the village pointing out the firm rules of the field, of being a responsible dog owner and the fine that not picking up incurs could perhaps make this minority understand it’s not acceptable?

I feel a blanket ban on the responsible owners of the village is an unfair action to take because from observation dog exercising is possibly the most common use of this field !</div>

#### Allow - View #12 :

<div class="view"> I feel it would be a shame to ban dogs all together. I think we need to consider maybe having a poo bin for dogs up there and like other villages do.

And it is such a shame that a few irresponsible dog owners are going to be responsible for dogs not being allowed on the Playing Fields. Living so close to the Playing Field . I would be concerned that some parents will not bring their children up to the playing fields if they cannot exercise their dogs at the same time. As we all know the Playing Field is not used as much as it should be.

Another issue that I feel we have here is that there is no safe path to the Playing Field and cars are parked on that corner which I feel is not safe for children walking to the park on their own and also it’s very difficult to see if the road is clear coming out of the cul-de-sac.

As a resident of this cul-de-sac, we are still trying to obtain management of this road and we will of course then make sure it is safe for children. I personally do not walk my dogs that often in the park. I may walk through the park to get to the bridal path but would be happy to walk round should I ban come into place .

A sign also would help new residents see that there is a park. </div>

#### Allow - View #13 :

<div class="view"> Whilst we don’t use the field to exercise our own dogs much, my concern is for less conscientious dog owners and the welfare of their dog if they don’t have an ‘easy’ convenient place to exercise their dogs. </div>
