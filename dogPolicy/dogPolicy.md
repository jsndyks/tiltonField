## Tilton Playing Field - Proposed Dog Policy

### Dogs Prohibited on Playing Field from 1st June 2023

In determining a policy for safe use of the playing field we have listened to the community, guidance and considered advice from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA).

[RoSPA](https://www.rospa.com/play-safety/advice/dogs) advise that **Dogs on children's playgrounds represent a major health &amp; injury hazard**.

This is predominantly through:

1.  [Toxocariasis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxocariasis/) - a rare infection caused by roundworm parasites found in faeces that has bene termed '[the Parasite of the Playground](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/health/toxocara-children-new-york-playgrounds.html)', and
2.  [dog bites and attacks](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/find-data-and-publications/supplementary-information/2019-supplementary-information-files/admissions-to-hospital-for-dog-bite-injuries) - with over 7,000 hospital admissions per year in the UK for those _bitten or struck by dog_ with under 10s the most likely to be admitted.

While many people have enjoyed exercising their dogs on the field during the trial dual-usage period since 2015, and most have done so responsibly, most of the communications to the Parish Council since then have been against continuing this policy, for reasons of safety.

Given the continued prevalence of dog faeces on the playing field during March and April, and the availability of quiet lanes and footpaths on which dogs can be exercised away from playing areas the Parish Council will prohibit dogs from the Playing Field from 1 June 2023.

We do so on the understanding that this will disrupt some legitimate use of the playing field, but in an effort to make the playing field safe for and attractive to all.

RoSPA also recommend developing publicity and education programmes regarding this issue. As such, _the Parish Council will suggest local lanes_ that are appropriate for dog walking.

Notices at both entrances to the Playing Field will communicate the new policy and we ask the community to adhere, and hope that you will continue to enjoy using the playing field, and exercise dogs responsibly elsewhere.

We also request that _all dog owners_ :

- pick up any dog excrement deposited in the village and dispose of this safely, _and_
- ensure that their dogs are receiving anthelmintic treatment (regular worming).

We remind villagers that a _Public Space Protection Order_ (PSPO) in relation to enhanced dog controls is in operation across the Harborough District, allowing a £100 fixed penalty fine to be issued to dog owners who do not pick up their dog's mess, and the possibility of dog owners being taken to court, where a fine of up to £1000 can be issued on conviction.
