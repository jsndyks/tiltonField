Hello Counsellors,

I have put together a few short documents to help us with the decision on dogs on the Playing Field in May.

I hope you will access them and provide feedback in the next week or two.

They include ...

1. A Proposed Dog Policy - based on what the Parish Council agreed in May 2021.
   Is this something that we can vote on in May 2023?
   Please let me know your thoughts and whether this needs to change in any way before it is tabled.

2. A reminder of the Community Vision Statements that we use to maintain and develop the Playing Field.
   Please read.

3. The results of the Public Consultation in which the village was found to be split 50:50.
   A useful reminder.

4. Selected Evidence to Inform opinions and debate.
   If you would like me to add other sources, please send them to me.

5. A reminder of the Public Space Protection Order that allows fines to be issued for anti-social canine behaviour.

The Aims of the Playing Field Committee taken from the Terms of Reference. We should all remind ourselves of these from time to time.

I have also set up a feedback form to try to solicit views from the village. I will make all of this information available to villagers and solicit reactions.

My understanding of Monday night was that the ban will be considered "if things don't improve".
But it was not clear to me who is inspecting the field or how?
Remember that I reported improvement at the February meeting.

So, could I ask that in addition to reading and commenting upon the above, you each visit the field twice before May to assess the extent of the problem.
I'd ask you to do so once in March and once in April.
I will ask for views at the May meeting.

Comments on all of this by end of Feb please.
That gives everybody a good chance, and means that I can get information out to the village in good time.

I hope that the PFC can vote on its recommendation at the PFC meeting. All villagers are welcome as ever, including counsellors.
The PFC "_advise[s] upon the management and development_" of the field, and so it's down to the Parish Council to decide what to do with this advice. My advice is that we all vote at the PC on a recommendation, and then, given that this feels like a big issue to do with an important village facility, the PC votes on what to do given the PFC advice.

As such, it would be a good idea to get a "_Playing Field Dog Policy_" item on the main PC agenda for May.

Thanks.

Jay.
