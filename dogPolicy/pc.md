Hello Counsellors,

I have put together a few short documents to help us with the decision on dogs on the Playing Field in May.

I hope you will access them and provide feedback in the next week or two.

They include

1. A Proposed Dog Policy - based on what the Parish Council agreed in May 2021. Is this something that we can vote on in May 2023? Please let me know if this needs to change in any way.

2. A reminder of the Community Vision Statements that we use to maintain and develop the Playing Field.

3. The results of the Public Consultation in which the village was found to be split 50:50.

4. Selected Evidence to Inform opinions and debate.
   If you would like me to add other sources, please send them to me

5. A reminder of the Public Space Protection Order that allows fines to be issued for anti-social canine behaviour.

I have also set up a feedback form to try to solicit views from the village. I will make all of this information available to villagers.

My understanding of Monday night was that the ban will be considered "if things don't improve".
But it was not clear to me who is inspecting the field or how?
Remember that I reported improvement at the February meeting.

So, could I ask that in addition to reading and commenting upon the above, you each visit the field twice before May to assess the extent of the problem.
I'd ask you to do so once in March and once in April.
I will ask for views at the May meeting.

Comments on all of this by end of Feb please.
That gives everybody a good chance, and means that I can get information out to the village in good time.

Thanks.

Jay.
