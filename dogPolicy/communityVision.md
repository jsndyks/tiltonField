## Tilton Playing Field - Community Vision

### Public Consultation - Vision Statements

The [Community Vision & Action Plan](../docs/Tilton%20Playing%20Field%20-%20Community%20Vision%20%26%20Action%20Plan.pdf) contained the following **Vision Statements** that we have used to maintain and develop the field.

> Throughout the engagement and consultation process completed in relation to the Tilton Playing Field views, priorities, and ideas have been gathered from across residents of Tilton & Halstead in order to develop a community vision for the future appearance, feel, use, and management of the site.

The most important in the context of the dog ban issue is:

> “_**The Tilton Playing Field will be open and free to use by all sections of the community. Restrictions and rules will only be applied to ensure the site can be enjoyed safely and fairly by all.**_”
