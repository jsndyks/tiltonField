## Tilton Playing Field - Dog Risk

### Evidence to Inform Dog Policy on Tilton Field

The key risks to health are _bites_ and _toxocariasis_, an infection caused by roundworm parasites found in faeces.

There are of course many reports and many views, but the following, which I have attempted to select from authoritative sources and to give a balanced view, summarise things quite well.

#### Risk

The [British Journal of Sports Medicine](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/35/1/6) offered a useful leader article in 2001:

> "_Adults appear to be relatively resistant to symptomatic infection_"

> "_Risk is low, but hard to quantify._"

In summary:

> “_… canine defaecation poses a significant aesthetic hazard in playing fields. For children, there is a risk of serious toxocaral infection that may lead to visceral larva migrans or visual loss. For adults, the risk is much lower. Therefore everyone involved in the management of playing fields, whether public or private, should encourage dog owners to be responsible, clear up after their pets, and take steps to enforce this behaviour.”_

[Derbyshire CC](https://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/environment/dog-fouling/healthrisks/health-risks-dog-fouling-dangers-and-solutions.aspx) has some informative resources that support its [Yuk! Dog Fouling](https://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/environment/dog-fouling/yuk-dog-fouling.aspx) campaign.

Relevant information includes:

> "_In the UK there are around 100 cases of toxocariasis diagnosed each year._"

> "_Symptoms of toxocaral infection range from aches, dizziness and nausea to asthma and pneumonia symptoms of toxocaral infection range from aches, dizziness and nausea to asthma and pneumonia. In rare cases eye disease and loss of vision can be caused when the toxocara larva passes through the eye._"

#### Prevalence

The [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxocariasis/) reports that:

> _"Toxocariasis is rare in the UK, although it's hard to determine exactly how many cases occur every year, as the condition is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Many people are likely to have been exposed to the parasites without knowing it."_

#### Prevention

[RoSPA](https://www.rospa.com/play-safety/advice/dogs) recommends a number of measures to reduce risk, including _separate areas for dogs and children_, _dog exercising on leads only_ and _requesting that dog owners remove all faeces_.

The [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxocariasis/prevention/) suggests various methods of reducing the risk of [Toxocariasis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxocariasis/) for those using playgrounds and those owning pets.

#### Field in Trust

The Playing Field is a 'Field in Trust' - but this organization dodges the dog issue in it's [Dogs](https://www.fieldsintrust.org/knowledge-base/dogs) guidance, simply highlighting the problem:

> "_The issue of dogs on recreational green spaces can be both controversial and difficult to manage. Dogs and sport and children’s play do not go well together. Equally, owning and exercising with dogs is an important and popular lifestyle choice for many people. Fields in Trust’s view is that the issue is a matter for the landowner, and whether a site is protected with us or not we do not get involved. The challenge is to try to find a consensus that works for all based on the concept of responsible dog ownership._"
