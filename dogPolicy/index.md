## Tilton Playing Field - Dog Policy

At its February 13th meeting, Tilton on the Hill Playing Field Committee discussed the issue of _dog excrement_, which continues to be something of a problem on the field.

A _trial period_, during which **dogs would be banned from the Playing Field** was proposed.

There was lots of discussion and some disagreement, and so the Committee agreed to :

- _monitor the situation_ in March and April and _decide_ on the proposal at the May meeting (item 3)
- _seek views_ for consideration at the May meeting
- consider _previous correspondence_ on the matter

As chair of the Playing Field Committee I want to ensure that all can see the proposal and all can contribute to the discussion before the Parish Council decides on the matter at the next meeting - 22nd May.

So, here you will find a series of documents relating to _Dog Policy_ on _Tilton Playing Field_ and an opportunity to let the Parish Council know your views.

Please read these through to inform your thinking as we discuss the Parish Council's policy as regards the exercising of dogs on the field.

1. A reminder of the [Community Vision Statements](communityVision.md) that were agreed following the community consultation that occurred in 2015, that we use to maintain and develop the _Playing Field_.

2. results of the [Public Consultation](publicConsultation.md) undertaken in 2014, in which the village expressed it views on whether or not dogs should be allowed to exercise on the field. These were split 50:50.

3. The proposed [Proposed Dog Policy](dogPolicy.md) - this is what the _Parish Council_ will be voting on in May 2023 in light of inspections of the Playing field in the preceding months.

4. Selected [Evidence to Inform Dog Policy on Tilton Field](dogRisk.md) that should be used to inform opinions and debate

5. The _Public Space Protection Order_ that covers [Dog Fouling & Dog Control](pspo.md) in Harborough District

It's also worth considering the [Terms of Reference](tor.md) under which the _Playing Field Committee_ operates - the most important of these are probably the _Aims_:

<div style="font-size:85%; color:#666; margin-left:2em" markdown="1">

The _Tilton Playing Field Committee_ **aims** to generate funds, organise activities and advise the Parish Council on the management and development of the Playing Field to:

- 1.1 Provide a facility for healthy outdoor recreation by maintaining, managing and developing the Playing Field Land for games, sporting activities and other organised and serendipitous outdoor pursuits.

- 1.2 Make information about facilities and activities available to residents.

- 1.3 Encourage and support residents in organising and participating in outdoor recreational activity on the field.

- 1.4 Operate in accordance with the views of residents and to further equal opportunities for all groups.

Once you have done that, then feel free to use this form through which [Views on Dog Policy](https://bit.ly/tiltonFieldDogs) can be logged for consideration by the _Parish Council_.

The _Playing Field Committee_ meeting on **22nd May** is held in public, and anyone in the village(s) can participate - and I encourage you to do so, to let your views be known.<br/>We start at **7pm** in the **Village Hall**.

Finally, _a call for calm_.

Village volunteers have put in hundreds of hours and raised many thousands of pounds to give Tilton a great permanent secure facility for healthy outdoor recreation.

Dog exercising is a contentious issue with strong feelings on each side.

Please let's remember that we have committed to working together to maintain and develop the field for the good of the village and so we need to see the good in a village decision, whatever is decided.

I would ask all to present their views with strength, but dispassionately, and with respect.

Please listen graciously to the views of others and consider all perspectives.
This will help us move forwards as we tackle a thorny and challenging issue.
