## Tilton Playing Field - Dog Exercising

At its the February meeting of the Tilton on the Hill Playing Field Committee the issue of _dog excrement_ was discussed, with some present believing that this continues to be a problem on the field.

A _trial period_, during which **dogs would be banned from the Playing Field** was proposed and supported by the majority present.

There was lots of discussion, and some disagreement, and so the Committee agreed to ...

- _monitor the situation_ in March and April
- _seek views_ from the village and consider _previous correspondence_ on the matter
- _decide_ on whether to implement the proposed ban on dogs at the next meeting - 22nd May

The Parish Council and Playing Field Committee want to ensure that all can see the proposal and all can contribute to the discussion before the Parish Council decides on the matter in May.
