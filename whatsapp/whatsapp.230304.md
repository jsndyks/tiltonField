Tilton Playing Field - Dog Exercising
1/12

At its the February meeting of the Tilton on the Hill Playing Field Committee the issue of _dog excrement_ was discussed, with some present believing that this continues to be a problem on the field.
2/12

A _trial period_, during which **dogs would be banned from the Playing Field** was proposed and supported by the majority present.

There was lots of discussion, and some disagreement, and so the Committee agreed to ...
3/12

- _monitor the situation_ in March and April
- _seek views_ from the village and consider _previous correspondence_ on the matter
- _decide_ on whether to implement the proposed ban on dogs at the next meeting - 22nd May
  4/12

As chair of the Playing Field Committee I want to ensure that all can see the proposal and all can contribute to the discussion before the Parish Council decides on the matter in May.

So I have put together a series of short documents relating to Dog Policy on Tilton Playing Field, including the proposed policy, and an opportunity to let the Parish Council know your views before the May meeting.

Finally, I am well aware that this is a contentious issue with strong feelings on each side. Please let's remember that we have committed to working together to give Tilton a facility for healthy outdoor recreation. Many hundreds of hours have been volunteered and many thousands of pounds secured to achieve this.
I would ask all to present their views with strength and clarity, but importantly, with respect. Please also listen respectfully to the views of others and work to consider their needs and perspectives.

Sorry for the long message - but please spread the word and follow the link.
Do keep discussion out of this PC group if possible.
