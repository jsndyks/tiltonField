At its the February meeting of the Tilton on the Hill Playing Field Committee the issue of _dog excrement_ was discussed, with some present indicating that this continues to be a problem on the field.

A _trial period_, during which **dogs would be banned from the Playing Field** was proposed.

There was lots of discussion and some disagreement, and so the Committee agreed to :

- _monitor the situation_ in March and April
- _seek views_ for consideration and consider _previous correspondence_ on the matter
- _decide_ on the proposal at the May meeting

As chair of the Playing Field Committee I want to ensure that all can see the proposal and all can contribute to the discussion before the Parish Council decides on the matter in May.

So I have put together a series of short documents relating to Dog Policy on Tilton Playing Field, including the proposed policy and an opportunity to let the Parish Council know your views.

Please read these through to inform your thinking and follow the link to let the Parish Council know your view as we assess the policy on the exercising of dogs on the field.

Thanks,

Jay.
