Hi Counsellors,

I received very little back on this, and so will send the information to the village on the WhatsApp group this weekend once the sonic boom excitement is over.

Thanks for the one commitment to visit the field a couple of times.
I really hope you will all take this up and do the other things I requested (in red).

A few clarifications:

- we will vote on the proposal, in light of community feedback, at the PFC meeting in May (7:00pm).

- The PFC's role is to guide the PC, and I have asked Jenny to add this specific issue to agenda of the main PC meeting that follows at 7:30 so that the PC votes on what to do given, the PFC advice. That's where the policy decision is made.

- as indicated in our defining vision statements, the PFC needs to "operate in an open and transparent manner, maintain strong communication links" and "work together to maintain and develop" the playing field. Seeking views from the village is an essential part of this. Personally, I wish the PC was more open, active and consultative in its communication, but that's just a personal view.

- this is the quickest way that we are able to act given the decisions at the Feb meeting (that's why I waste my weekends preparing proposals and documents).

Happy Saturday.

Jay.
