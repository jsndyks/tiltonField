## Harborough District Council

### Dog Fouling & Dog Control

A Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) in relation to enhanced dog controls is in operation across the Harborough District.

This creates a comprehensive and consistent approach when dealing with issues such as dog fouling, and other forms of irresponsible dog ownership.

The PSPO covers all land to which the public can gain access, including agricultural land, footpaths and public playing fields on which dogs are allowed.

In summary this order makes it an offence _to fail to_ :

- _Pick up after your dog_ – leaving dog mess in a public space is an offence
- _Put a dog on a lead when directed to do so by an authorised officer_ – this allows council officers to direct that a dog is put on a lead when it is causing nuisance and/or danger to other persons and their dogs
- _Provide at the request of an authorised officer the means to pick up after a dog_

Any breach of the PSPO could result in :

- the issuing of a £100 fixed penalty notice, or
- dog owners being taken to court and receiving a fine on conviction of up to £1,000.
